\section{Basic Statistics}

The features are very different in their values as well as in their meaning. We decided to do a normalization accross all those features, that indicate quality (eg. if the house has a garage or fireplace \texttt{FireplaceQu}). Many quality related features are rated on this scale:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ex:~~~ Excellent -- Exceptional Masonry Fireplace
    \item Gd:~~~ Good -- Masonry Fireplace in main level
    \item TA:~~~ Average -- Prefabricated Fireplace in main living area or Masonry Fireplace in basement
    \item Fa:~~~ Fair -- Prefabricated Fireplace in basement
    \item Po:~~~ Poor -- Ben Franklin Stove
    \item NA:~~~ No Fireplace
\end{itemize}

There are other quality related features, but they have already have a numerical scale from $1 to 10$, which we did not change. We scaled the quality-related features with string values to numerical values, using the numbers from $0 to 10$. We used a step of $2$ with $10$ meaning \texttt{Excellent} and $0$ meaning \texttt{Not Available}. This gives us a comparable quality measurement accross many attributes.
