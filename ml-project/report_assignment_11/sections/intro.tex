\section{Introduction}

The dataset contains very verbose housing data, to be found here: \url{https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques}. Each house (row) in the training data is described by 81 features. The target variable is called \texttt{SalePrice} and is only present in the training data. A submission to the kaggle challenge should only include house IDs of the test data set and the predicted sale prices. 

We use k-fold cross validation with 5 folds on the training data. This split enables us to reason about our prediction precision. 

While working on this exercise, we frequently uploaded our prediction results to kaggle and got scored on the leaderboard. We were able to reach rank 782 from 4972 competitors (top 16\%). We learned how important data preprocessing is in order to reach better scores.
