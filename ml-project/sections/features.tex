\section{Feature Analysis}

We constructed a pairwise correlation matrix accross all features. The corresponding plot can be found in \texttt{plots/feature_correlation.png}. We set a configurable threshold to determine interesting correlation of features. When the script is executed, a full list is printed.

Many features that rate quality are correlated. This indicates, that houses are generally either of higher or lower quality accross many measured aspects, but not wildly mixed with high and low quality attributes.

Some features are directly correlated with the \texttt{SalePrice}. They appear to be typical factors for housing prizes, such as the quality of the kitchen and basement as well as the size of the garage or the first floor.
