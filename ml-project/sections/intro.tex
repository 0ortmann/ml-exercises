\section{Introduction}

We decided to use a beginner friendly data-set, to be found here: \url{https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques}. The data-set is split in equally sized train and test sets, each of which can be downloaded individually. It is described on the webpage as a nice data-set to learn with and improve knowledge.

Our data-set contains very verbose housing data. Each house (row) is described by 81 features. One of the is the ID, so that feature is rather uninteresting. Another feature is the sale price. This feature is the one we are going to predict, using the remaining 79 features.

The interesting challenge here is to handle the multitude of features. With traditional price prediction, most tutorials use much less dimensions. It will be interesting to see, which dimensions impact sale prices most and which dont.
